# Basic-Keras-API
This repository is the implementation of [blog](https://blog.keras.io/building-a-simple-keras-deep-learning-rest-api.html), which is about building a simple rest api. This is one of the easiest way of starting your journey in deep learning. 
I have used the transfer learning and hence we have used the model "ResNet50" as well as for the pretrainted weights we have used "imagenet".
The API is builded using the Flask - A python microframework. 
You can easily clone this repo and customize it as per your need.

# Getting Started
To start with this repo you must have pre installed Keras (and a supported backend) on your system. You also need to install Flask and requests on your system. 
Please Note that this code is written in Python 3.0 and the latest version of Flask (v. 1.0.2) is used.

Clone and make the deep learning FUN for yourself :)
